## Challenge: 

### Fruit Bowl

Imagine you have been using a single bowl for storing fruits for a long time as shown below.


Now you are finding the current bowl to be small, so you have bought a new basket stand that is multi-layered and will look much cleaner as you can segregate fruits better.

Now the goal is to segregate fruits from the current bowl to the multilayer fruit basket. You can choose any set of fruits and arrange them based on any parameter; colour, type, size etc.
